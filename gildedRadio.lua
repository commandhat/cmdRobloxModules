This module has been discontinued.

Roblox has decided to force all Guilded users to go through Roblox account creation.

This means anyone who wants to use Guilded will eventually need to contend with:

- An overly strict filter that is known to make chat useless and impossible to navigate
- An overly strict moderation team that is known to ban and mute, sometimes for no given reason whatsoever
- A total inability to promote services or platforms outside of the Roblox ecosystem ("facebook", "instagram", "tiktok" etc. are all banned words on Roblox)
- A total inability to fight or resolve anything negative happening to your social status (there is a social stigma surrounding Roblox in professional communities)

If you wish to continue using this module, grab a previous commit, but be aware all early commits are bug-filled and nearly useless due to API changes.

V1 will never happen unless the enforced change to Roblox accounts is completely cancelled.

Goodbye, Guilded.
